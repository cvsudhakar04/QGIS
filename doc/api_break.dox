/*! \page api_break Backwards Incompatible Changes

\tableofcontents

The API of QGIS libraries is allowed to be changed just between major versions of QGIS. For example, there
are various planned backwards incompatible changes between QGIS 1.8 and 2.0 because the version 2.0 is a new
major version. After a release of a major version of QGIS (e.g. 2.0) the developer team is committed to maintain
stable API for all subsequent minor releases (2.2, 2.4, ...). That roughly means we do not rename classes and methods,
remove them nor change their semantics. Existing code should keep working when the user updates QGIS
to another minor version (e.g. from 2.0 to 2.2), so all extensions of existing classes should be done in a manner that
third party developers do not need to adjust their code to work properly with newer QGIS releases.

Sometimes, however, we may need to break the API as a result of some code changes. These cases should be only exceptions
and they should happen only after consideration and agreement of the development team. Backwards incompatible changes
with too big impact should be deferred to a major version release.

This page tries to maintain a list with incompatible changes that happened in previous releases.

\subsection qgis_api_break_3_0_removed_classes Removed Classes

<ul>
<li>QgsColorbutton was removed. QgsColorButtonV2 has now been renamed to QgsColorButton. Hence, QgsColorButtonV2 does not exist anymore.
<li>QgsCRSCache was removed. QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem now internally uses a cache for CRS creation,
so there is no longer a need for the separate cache class. Code which previously called QgsCRSCache::updateCRSCache()
should now call QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::invalidateCache() and QgsCoordinateTransformCache::instance()->invalidateCrs( authid ).</li>
<li>QgsLabel and QgsLabelAttributes. Replaced by labeling based on PAL library, see QgsLabelingEngineV2.</li>
<li>QgsMapCanvasMap. It is an internal class used by map canvas.</li>
<li>QgsMapRenderer. It has been replaced by QgsMapRendererJob with subclasses and QgsMapSettings.</li>
<li>QgsPseudoColorShader. This shader has been broken for some time and was replaced by QgsSingleBandPseudoColorRenderer.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

\subsection qgis_api_break_3_0_QgsDataDefinedSymbolDialog QgsDataDefinedSymbolDialog

instead.</li>
</ul>

\subsection qgis_api_break_3_0_QgsDataItem QgsDataItem

<ul>

</ul>

\subsection qgis_api_break_3_0_QgsDiagramLayerSettings QgsDiagramLayerSettings

<ul>
<li>coordinateTransform() now returns a QgsCoordinateTransform object, not a pointer. An invalid QgsCoordinateTransform will

<li>setGeometryAndOwnership() has been removed. Use setGeometry() instead.</li>
<li>The setGeometry( QgsGeometry* ) method has been removed, use setGeometry( const QgsGeometry& ) instead.</li>
<li>The geometry() method now returns a copy of the geometry, not a pointer. Since QgsGeometry objects are
implicitly shared this is a low-cost copy, and avoids ownership and dangling pointer issues. <b>Very important: Testing that
a feature has a geometry is now done using the new hasGeometry() method. Any code which compares QgsFeature::geometry() to
None will need to be modified, as the method will return an empty geometry if the feature has no geometry.</b></li>
<li>The temporary constGeometry() method has been removed. Use geometry() instead.</li>

\subsection qgis_api_break_3_0_QgsGeometry QgsGeometry

<ul>
<li>All QgsGeometry methods now accept geometry references instead of pointers, and return a QgsGeometry
value instead of a pointer. The biggest impact with this change is that PyQGIS code should not compare a geometry
result to None, but instead either use a boolean test (`if g.buffer(10):`) or explicitly use the isEmpty()
method to determine if a geometry is valid.</li>
</ul>

\subsection qgis_api_break_3_0_QgsGeometryAnalyzer QgsGeometryAnalyzer

<ul>
<li>crs() now returns a QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem object, not a reference. This change has no effect for PyQGIS code.</li>

</ul>

\subsection qgis_api_break_3_0_QgsVectorDataProvider QgsVectorDataProvider

<ul>
<li>QgsVectorDataProvider::fields() now returns a copy, rather than a const reference. Since QgsFields
objects are implicitly shared, returning a copy helps simplify and make code more robust. This change
only affects third party c++ providers, and does not affect PyQGIS scripts.</li>
<li>The SaveAsShapefile, SelectGeometryAtId, RandomSelectGeometryAtId and SequentialSelectGeometryAtId
capabilities have been removed, as they were unused and had no effect.</li>
<li>capabilities() now returns a typesafe QgsVectorDataProvider::Capabilities object, not an integer.</li>
<li>convertToProviderType() now takes a geometry reference, not a pointer.</li>
<li>geometryType() has been renamed to wkbType() to be in line with QgsVectorLayer</li>

<li>excludeAttributesWFS() and setExcludeAttributesWFS() have been renamed to excludeAttributesWfs() and
setExcludeAttributesWfs()</li>
<li>The displayField property has been separated from the mapTip. For a plain text short title use the
displayExpression instead. For the map tip use mapTipTemplate() instead.</li>
<li>changeGeometry() now accepts a geometry reference, not a pointer.</li>
<li>The geometryChanged() signal now uses a const QgsGeometry reference.</li>
<li>The deprecated removePolygonIntersections has been removed.</li>
<li>addTopologicalPoints() now takes a geometry reference, not a pointer.</li>
<li>commitErrors() now returns an object, rather than a reference. This has no effect on PyQGIS code.</li>
<li>subsetString() was made const. This has no effect on PyQGIS code, but c++ code implementing derived layer classes will need to update the signature of this method to match.</li>
<li>label(), enableLabels(), hasLabelsEnabled(), drawLabels() have been removed. Replaced by labeling based on PAL library, see QgsLabelingEngineV2.</li>

<ul>
<li>QgsVectorLayerImport now takes references instead of pointers to QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem objects. Since
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem is now implicitly shared, using references to QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem rather than
pointers makes for more robust, safer code. Use an invalid (default constructed) QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem
in code which previously passed a null pointer to QgsVectorLayerImport.</li>

\subsection qgis_api_break_3_0_QgsVectorFileWriter QgsVectorFileWriter

<ul>
<li>QgsVectorFileWriter now takes references instead of pointers to QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem objects. Since
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem is now implicitly shared, using references to QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem rather than
pointers makes for more robust, safer code. Use an invalid (default constructed) QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem
in code which previously passed a null pointer to QgsVectorFileWriter.</li>

\section qgis_api_break_2_4 QGIS 2.4

\subsection qgis_api_break_mtr Multi-threaded Rendering

<ul>
<li>QgsMapCanvas::refresh() only schedules a map refresh (in near feature) and returns immediately - before it would do the drawing immediately
and return when the map is redrawn. A call to refresh() will have no effect if there is already a scheduled pending refresh.
When map canvas does actual rendering, it will first emit renderStarting() signal, once done it will emit mapCanvasRefreshed().
The client code doing refresh() in order to later save map image should be updated to use new QgsMapRendererJob API which is better suited for such task.
<li>QgsPluginLayer::draw() is now run in a background thread. It is recommended to implement newly added QgsPluginLayer::createMapRenderer()
method instead of using QgsPluginLayer::draw().
</ul>

\subsection qgis_api_break_legend_refactoring Legend Refactoring
