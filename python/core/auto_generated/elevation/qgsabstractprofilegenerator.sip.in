class QgsAbstractProfileGenerator
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
Abstract base class for objects which generate elevation profiles.

The generation is typically done in a background
thread, so it is necessary to keep all structures required for generating the
profile away from the original profile source because it may change at any time.

Because the data needs to be copied (to avoid the need for locking),
it is highly desirable to use copy-on-write where possible. This way,
the overhead of copying (both memory and CPU) will be kept low.
Qt containers and various Qt classes use implicit sharing.

The scenario will be:

# elevation profile job (doing preparation in the GUI thread) calls
  :py:func:`QgsAbstractProfileSource.createProfileGenerator()` and gets an instance of this class.
  The instance is initialized at that point and should not need
  additional calls to the source.
# profile job (still in GUI thread) stores the generator for later use.
# profile job (in worker thread) calls :py:func:`QgsAbstractProfileGenerator.generateProfile()`
# profile job (again in GUI thread) will check :py:func:`~errors` and report them

Generate the profile (based on data stored in the class).

Returns ``True`` if the profile was generated successfully (i.e. the generation
was not canceled early).
