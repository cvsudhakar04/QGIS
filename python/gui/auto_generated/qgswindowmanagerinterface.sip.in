class QgsWindowManagerInterface
{
%Docstring
Interface for window manager.

An implementation of the window manager interface is usually retrieved from
the QgsGui instance, via :py:func:`QgsGui.windowManager()`

.. note::

   This is not considered stable API and may change in future QGIS versions.

.. versionadded:: 3.4

  public:

    enum StandardDialog
    {
      DialogStyleManager,
    };

    virtual ~QgsWindowManagerInterface();

    virtual QWidget *openStandardDialog( StandardDialog dialog ) = 0;
%Docstring
Opens an instance of a standard QGIS dialog. Depending on the window manager
implementation, this may either open a new instance of the dialog or bring an
existing instance to the foreground.

Returns the dialog if shown, or None if the dialog either could not be
created or is not supported by the window manager implementation.
%End

    virtual QString executeExportVectorLayerDialog( QgsVectorLayer *layer );
%Docstring
Executes the standard "Export Vector Layer" dialog for the specified ``layer``,
and performs an export using the settings accepted in the dialog.

The created vector file name is returned.

Depending on the window manager implementation the actual export of the
layer may occur in a background task, in which case calling this method
will immediately return after the dialog has been accepted, but before
the exported layer has been finalized.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`executeExportRasterLayerDialog`

.. versionadded:: 3.6
%End

    virtual QString executeExportRasterLayerDialog( QgsRasterLayer *layer );

Executes the standard "Export Raster Layer" dialog for the specified ``layer``,

The created raster file name is returned.

Depending on the window manager implementation the actual export of the
