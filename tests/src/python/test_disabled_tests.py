        test createChildren() method implemented in Python, called from C++

        This test was originally working under Qt 5.12, but is broken on newer Qt or sip
        versions. The test currently segfaults, as the children created by the python QgsDataCollectionItem
        subclass PyQgsDataConnectionItem are immediately garbage collected.

        The SIP SIP_VIRTUAL_CATCHER_CODE in qgsdataitem.h is supposed to fix this situation by
        adding an extra reference to the returned python objects, but the lines

          // pyItem is given an extra reference which is removed when the C++ instanceâ€™s destructor is called.
          sipTransferTo( pyItem, Py_None );

        no longer have any effect and the object is still immediately deleted.

        Attempted solutions include:
        - all combinations of the existing VirtualCatcherCode with the different Factory/TransferBack annotations
        - removing the VirtualCatcherCode and replacing with raw Factory/TransferBack annotations
        - disabling the python garbage collection of the object entirely with sipTransferTo( pyItem, NULL )

        When fixed this test should be moved back to test_qgsdataitem.py
