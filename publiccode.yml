      ## Features


      ### 1. Flexible and powerful spatial data management


      - Supports raster, vector, mesh, and point cloud data in a range of
      industry-standard formats 
          - _Raster formats include_: GeoPackage, GeoTIFF, GRASS, ArcInfo binary and ASCII grids, ERDAS Imagine SDTS, WMS, WCS, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, and [other GDAL supported formats](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html).
          - _Vector formats include_: GeoPackage, ESRI Shapefiles, GRASS, SpatiaLite, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, MSSQL, Oracle, WFS, Vector Tiles and [other OGR supported formats](http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html).
          - _Mesh formats include_: NetCDF, GRIB, 2DM, and [other MDAL supported formats](https://github.com/lutraconsulting/MDAL#supported-formats).
          - _Point-cloud format_: LAS/LAZ and EPT datasets.
      - Access and display local files, spatial databases (PostGIS,  SpatiaLite,
      SQL Server, Oracle, SAP HANA), web services (WMS, WCS, WFS,  ArcGIS REST
      services), tile services, etc. 

      - Visual and numerical digitizing and editing

      - On-the-fly reprojection between coordinate reference systems (CRS)

      - Temporal support


      ### 2. Beautiful cartography


      - Large variety of rendering options in 2D and 3D

      - Fine control over symbology, labeling, legends and additional graphical
      elements for beautifully rendered maps

      - Advanced styling using data-defined overrides, blending modes, and draw
      effects

      - 500+ built-in color ramps (cpt-city, ColorBrewer, etc.)

      - Create and update maps with specified scale, extent, style, and
      decorations via saved layouts

      - Generate multiple maps (and reports) automatically using QGIS Atlas and
      QGIS Reports

      - Flexible output direct to printer, or as image (raster), PDF, or SVG for
      further customization

      - On-the-fly rendering enhancements using geometry generators (e.g. create
      and style new geometries from existing features)

      - Preview modes for inclusive map making (e.g. monochrome, color
      blindness)


      ### 3. Advanced and robust geospatial analysis


      - Powerful processing framework with 200+ native processing algorithms

      - Access to 1000+ processing algorithms via providers such as GDAL,  SAGA,
      GRASS, OrfeoToolbox, as well as custom models and processing  scripts

      - Geospatial database engine (filters, joins, relations, forms, etc.), as
      close to datasource- and format-independent as possible

      - Immediate visualization of geospatial query and geoprocessing results

      - Graphical modeler and batch processing


      ### 4. Powerful customization and extensibility


      - Fully customizable user experience, including user interface and 
      application settings that cater to power-users and beginners alike

      - Rich [expression
      engine](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/expression.html)
      for maximum flexibility in visualization and processing

      - Broad and varied [plugin ecosystem](https://plugins.qgis.org/) that
      includes data connectors, digitizing aids, advanced analysis and charting
      tools, in-the-field data capture, etc.

      - Style manager for creating, storing, and managing styles

      - [QGIS style hub](https://plugins.qgis.org/styles/) for easy sharing of
      styles

      - Python and C++ API for standalone (headless) applications as well as
      in-application comprehensive scripting (PyQGIS)


      ### 5. QGIS Server


      Headless map server -- running on Linux, macOS, Windows, or in a docker
      container -- that shares the same code base as QGIS.


      - Industry-standard protocols (WMS, WFS, WFS3/OGC API for Features and
      WCS) allow plug-n-play with any software stack

      - Works with any web server (Apache, nginx, etc) or standalone

      - All beautiful QGIS cartography is supported with best-in-class support
      for printing

      - Fully customizable with Python scripting support
